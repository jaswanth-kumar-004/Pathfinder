Installation and execution
----------------

- Clone the directory. 

- Go to the terminal to install Pyqt5 by using, 
```
pip install pyqt5
```
- Run PathFinder.py (Make sure FrontEnd.py is in the same directory)

Algorithms supported:
---------------------

- A * Search (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
